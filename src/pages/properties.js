							Machine Learning is the field of study
							that gives computers the capability to
							learn without being explicitly
							programmed. ML is one of the most exciting
							technologies that one would have ever
							come across. As it is evident from the
							name, it gives the computer that makes
							it more similar to humans: The ability
							to learn. Machine learning is actively
							being used today, perhaps in many more
							places than one would expect.
