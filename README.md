# What You Need
In order to make our product work, you will need to install multiple dependencies that are easily found online. First, you will need to VS Code and Visual Studio. All links to dependencies will be included at the end of this section. Once you have these programs downloaded, you will need to have a way to work with ralational databases. We utilized AWS RDS but there are countless choices for how to do this. We also recommend getting MySQL Workbench to help with making database modifications. 

Now that all you have of the programs & subscriptions you can focus on installing the dependencies that the actual code requires. This includes npm, React, & Bootstrap. Links to information about installing those are also linked below.
